# SpongeBob_Text
This program is to "SpongeBob-ify" a text string.

This will take an input body of text and then change the case of each letter to upper and lower case, this is to mimic the SpongeBob meme text style.
There is also a function to paste text into the program and to copy it so it can be used elsewhere.
